## Technical Requirements:

1. **API Integration:**
    - Fetch service and event data from a RESTful API.
    - Utilize Tanstack Query for efficient data management.
2. **Responsiveness:**
    - Ensure the website is responsive and accessible for tab and mobile devices.
3. **Animation:**

    - Integrate animations that are relevant to the theme and purpose of your website. Consider animations that enhance the visual appeal and engagement of users.
    - You can use any kind of animation library or framework.
    - **Animation Libraries/Frameworks Examples:**
        1. **Framer Motion:**
            - **Usage:** Apply Framer Motion for smooth and interactive animations.
            - **Example:** Use Framer Motion to create a captivating entrance animation for the main headline in the Header section, where the text gracefully fades and scales into view.
        2. **AOS (Animate On Scroll):**
            - **Usage:** Implement AOS to trigger animations as users scroll down the page.
            - **Example:** Apply AOS to the Our Services section, causing service cards to slide in or fade as they enter the user's viewport during scrolling.
        3. **Anime.js:**
            - **Usage:** Apply Anime.js for lightweight and flexible animations.
            - **Example:** Implement Anime.js to add a subtle bounce effect to pricing plan elements in the Pricing section when users hover over them.
        4. **React Spring:**
            - **Usage:** Integrate React Spring for physics-based animations.
            - **Example:** Use React Spring to create a gallery image carousel in the Gallery section, where images slide and fade with a natural, physics-inspired motion.
        
        Feel free to explore these animation libraries/frameworks and choose the one that aligns best with your project's needs. Each has its unique features and advantages, allowing you to create captivating and responsive animations.
        
4. **Technology Stack:**
    - TypeScript
